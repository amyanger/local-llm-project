{"instruction": "Explain what a for loop does", "response": "A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each item. Example:\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between == and is in Python?", "response": "== compares values (equality), while 'is' compares object identity (whether two variables point to the same object in memory).

{"instruction": "How do I handle exceptions in Python?", "response": "Use try-except blocks:\n\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print('Cannot divide by zero')\nfinally:\n    print('This always runs')"}
